# DoorCheeseFix

Reworks how doors behave:

### Small (weak) doors:
* Once the door has opened one fourth of the way, the door is considered open and sound as well as enemies can now go through.
* Once the door has closed three fourths of the way, the door is considered closed and no sound or enemies can go through anymore.

### Security doors:
* propagate sound as soon as it makes sense for them to do so.  
No more silent shots through zone doors!

### Door bug?
This does also fix "door bug", aka the bug that makes enemies unable to walk through a broken door.

### Note
All of those changes slightly increase the time frame that enemies are able to pass through doors, which in turn might increase difficulty a tiny bit overall.
