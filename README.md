# DoorCheeseFix

Reworks how the small (weak) doors opening and closing behavior works:

* Once the door has opened one fourth of the way, the door is considered open and sound as well as enemies can now go through.
* Once the door has closed three fourths of the way, the door is considered closed and no sound or enemies can go through anymore.

This does **not** fix "door bug", aka the bug that makes enemies unable to walk through a broken door.
